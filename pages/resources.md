# Resources

I decided it is about time to stop resource hoarding and stop to the mindset of gate keeping and share the best of the best resources I ever came by.
ALL of the stuff below are based on my thought process which I believe that learning by doing, censory incentives to stay motivated and learning just enough to be able to do the actual stuff stead of doing a 6 months course.

I will be biased in making the list and would aim at all the Neuro Divergent ambitious people who could do better with more dopamine indecuing interactive lessons unlike plain text documentations and text books, also on they way make some cool projects.

P.s. not all the stuff listed below are guaranteed to be applicable to everyone so, use it, go through it with a pinch of salt.
