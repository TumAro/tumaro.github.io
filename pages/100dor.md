# 100 Days of Robotics

I am making this curriculum while I go. I keep in mind about people like me who did not come from robotics or engineering background, but with basic maths and enough of python basics, so that one can learn the fundamentals and get a grasp by hands-on practice.

There will be days which would look like can be done in one day but actually because of life or coding errors would take more than 1 day but that is fine! I am hoping to make this challange as something to teach and learn for the sake of love for it and not to impose artificial deadlines!

I will be laying this in 6 phases, namely,
- Phase 1: Foundation & Simulation environment
- Phase 2: Perception & Mapping
- Phase 3: Motion Planning & Control
- Phase 4: Learning & Adaption
- Phase 5: Advance Integration & System Design
- Phase 6: Final Project

After I have update at least the Phase 1 fully, then I will release the github repo for everyone to use as reference. Meanwhile you can check on my timely updates in my [twitter](https://twitter.com/tumaro1001)
