# Tumin Sharma
Hello everyone! Welcome to my website 👋
<br>
I'm a mathematics graduate from Behala College, Kolkata (University of Calcutta) with a Bachelor's in Pure Mathematics. My passions include Robotics, Number Theory, Coding, and lately, Artificial Intelligence. My strong mathematical foundation and love for tech inspire me to explore these subjects deeply and contribute to academic discussions. I'd love to connect and exchange ideas with fellow enthusiasts!
