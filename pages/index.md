# Tumin Sharma ðŸ‘¦
Hello everyone! Welcome to my website ðŸ‘‹
<br>
I'm a mathematics graduate from Behala College, Kolkata (University of Calcutta) with a Bachelor's in Pure Mathematics. My passions include Robotics ðŸ¤–, Number Theory, Coding ðŸ’», and lately, Artificial Intelligence ðŸ¤–ðŸ§ . My strong mathematical foundation and love for tech inspire me to explore these subjects deeply and contribute to academic discussions. I'd love to connect and exchange ideas with fellow enthusiasts!
